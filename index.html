                  Free Code Camp is a website offering various curriculum to learn how to code.<br/>
                 Here is their high-level map to go from complete newbie to full-stack developer:<a href="www.freecodecamp.org"> Full courses here </a> <br/>
                The first three certifications — Front End, Data Visualization and Back End — are independent.<br/>
                 You can take any of it in the order you like. Many campers have gotten jobs as front-end or back-end developers simply by working through the material in these sections.<br/> 
                  However, in order to be able to work on the Full Stack certification, which consists of working on real-world projects for charities, it is required to have obtained the first three, which makes sense!<br/>
